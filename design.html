<div class="textImageDesignOne"><h3 align="center">Initial Concept</h3>
    <p align="center">To decide what kind of web game to make we first researched other web games for ones which we enjoyed. <br>
        We found some stacking games and enjoyed how simple the idea is but also how fun it could be to play. We started brainstorming about different <br>
        ideas for levels and ways of making the game more interesting. <br>
        We decided that we would make a limit on how low you can drop the object to make it a little more <br>
        difficult to see where the shapes would drop. This would also mean that the objects would be hitting other objects with a bit more force than <br>
        if you drop it from just above the previous object.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="textImageDesignTwo"><h3 align="center">Final Concept</h3>
    <p align="center">While making the game we had many ideas of different ways to make the game harder and more fun. <br>
        One thing we tried was to add was a level which would choose a random shape we have made after every object has been dropped so that <br>
        you never know what the next object coming is. This was more difficult than we originally thought and we couldn't get it to work properly. <br>
        We were also going to try to have a level where you have to try stack as many objects as possible before they all fall over but to do this <br>
        we had to add vertical scrolling so that you are not limited by the height of the game window. <br>
        We were struggling to have the collisions and boundaries working with this so we decided to take it out.
